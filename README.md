# Effect-of-stock-market-in-new-moon-or-full-moon

This is just a fun project.
I just see a blog where someguy ask a question whether new moon or full moon effect stock market or not. Most of the religious festival are measured by moon size(earlier people use calender on basis of revolution of moon ) and new moon is consider as new and fresh beginning so that I decided to see whether this belief effect investing decision or not
that's why I collect data of nearby full moon or new moon and take the average return (most of the time stock market remain close in full/new moon because of holiday that's why take the next or previous day of that day)  and see the average return to see 
Whether that statement was true or not
